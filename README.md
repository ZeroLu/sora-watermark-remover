## The Problem: The Annoying Dynamic Watermark

Since Sora's launch, its stunning AI-generated videos have gone viral on platforms like TikTok. However, a major frustration for creators is the persistent and **dynamic watermark**.

OpenAI has made it particularly challenging to get a clean version: screen recording is often blocked on the app, and every video on the web has this moving watermark embedded. Because it's dynamic, traditional removal methods often fail or leave ugly artifacts.
